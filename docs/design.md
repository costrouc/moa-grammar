# Design

This is a document that is used to help clarify the implementation and
the assumptions being made. It also aims to provide a roadmap towards
the actual implementation and allow for criticism before any specific
design is chosen.

This project is already on great footing due to a formal specification
of the MOA grammar which allows us to have most of the design
decisions already made.
